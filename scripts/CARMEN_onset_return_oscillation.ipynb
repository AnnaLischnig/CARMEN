    "CARMEN Trace Analysis Script – Onset, Return, and Oscillation Detection\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This script performs post-processing of calcium multiplexing data exported from the CARMEN Fiji macro and \n",
    "post processed with CARMEN_combine_and_curvefitting_xlsmtemplate.ipynb .\n",
    "\n",
    "For each input Excel file (.xlsm), the script:\n",
    "- Loads time series and fluorescence intensity data.\n",
    "- Applies Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise in signal traces.\n",
    "- Calculates the first derivative of each smoothed trace to identify activation onset times.\n",
    "- Defines a baseline region and calculates the time taken for the signal to return to baseline.\n",
    "- Detects oscillations (peaks and troughs) between onset and return.\n",
    "- Plots raw, smoothed, and derivative traces for visual inspection, highlighting key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "- Derivative-based onset detection using `scipy.signal.find_peaks`, adjustable for signal polarity.\n",
    "- Baseline return detection using threshold-based criteria with configurable tolerance and duration.\n",
    "- Detection of oscillations between onset and return using prominence-based peak/trough filtering.\n",
    "- High-resolution visualisation of signal features across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "- Input files are `.xlsm` Excel workbooks with a sheet named 'Time Analysis'.\n",
    "- Time is stored in the column named 'Protocol Time [sec]'.\n",
    "- Signal data are found in columns C, D, and E (representing GFP, RFP, and NIR).\n",
    "- Signals are ordered consistently across files, and rows with NaN values are excluded automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "- Set `folder_path` to the directory containing your input `.xlsm` files.\n",
    "- Adjust analysis parameters at the top of the script to suit your experimental design.\n",
    "- Run the script in a Python environment with the required dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "- Printed console summaries of detected onset, return, and duration per signal.\n",
    "- Matplotlib plots showing raw, smoothed, and derivative signals with annotated onsets and returns.\n",
