    "CARMEN Calcium Multiplexing Post-Processing Script\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This script combines and background-subtracts ROI intensity measurements from four-channel calcium imaging\n",
    "experiments processed using the CARMEN Fiji macro (CARMEN_MeasureFourChannelROI.ijm).\n",
    "The script assumes that the last ROI in each CSV file represents a background region and uses its values for background subtraction. \n",
    "It expects CSV files to be exported per image and per channel (e.g., \"Image01_Intensity FP1.csv\" through \"Image01_Intensity FP4.csv\"), \n",
    "and merges these into a single Excel file containing both the original measurements and background-corrected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality:\n",
    "- Scans a folder for CSV files matching the expected naming convention.\n",
    "- Groups CSVs by image base name, ensuring exactly four files per group (FP1 to FP4).\n",
    "- Loads the files and writes the raw data into separate Excel sheets (FP1, FP2, FP3, FP4).\n",
    "- Applies background subtraction using the last column (assumed to be background values).\n",
    "- Saves corrected data in additional sheets (FP1_bs, FP2_bs, FP3_bs, FP4_bs) within the same Excel file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "- CSV files follow the naming convention: \"<base_name>_Intensity FPX.csv\"\n",
    "- The last column in each CSV contains background intensity values.\n",
    "- All CSVs are located in a single folder, defined by `file_path`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs:\n",
    "- For each image (base_name), creates an Excel file: \"<base_name>_analysis.xlsx\"\n",
    "  - Sheets: FP1, FP2, FP3, FP4          — Raw data\n",
    "  - Sheets: FP1_bs, FP2_bs, FP3_bs, FP4_bs — Background-subtracted data\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "- Set the `file_path` to the folder containing CSV exports from the CARMEN Fiji macro.\n",
    "- Run the script in a Python environment with `pandas` installed.\n",
